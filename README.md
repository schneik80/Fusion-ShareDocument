# Share Menu


## Description

Sharing is core to collaborative design. The Share Menu makes it easier to access sharing tools.

**Get Share Link** enables sharing, generates a public share link with Downloads enabled and then copies the link to the system clipboard. You can then paste into text or emails to quickly share the document.

Note. The document must be saved, and your Fusion Team Hub must have enabled share links for sharing to work. If aharing is disabled, a private perma-link will be copied to clipboard instead. This link will only allow Team hub members access to the document details page.",


**Change Share Settings** allows you to adjust the active documents share settings from the same menu.

**open on web**

Settings control:

- Turn sharing on and off.
- Turn permission to download the shared document on and off.
- Add a password to protect the share link

If download is turned off, the recipient of the link will only be able to view the document.

## Access
